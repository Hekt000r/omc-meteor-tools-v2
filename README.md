# OMC Meteor Tools
A collection of meteor modules for my team (but also for others) designed to help and assist in advertising and making projects on 6b6t.

## Features and credits (current)
Auto-Advertising | Lets you advertise in the chat with a delay and multiple messages, like the Macro function in meteor but you dont have to keep pressing the button| [Meteor Client Macro Feature (some of its code)](https://github.com/MeteorDevelopment/meteor-client/blob/master/src/main/java/meteordevelopment/meteorclient/systems/macros/Macro.java)

Meteor-Litematica-Printer (new) | A copy of the litematica printer module from Meteor-Litematica-Printer but its updated for 1.21.5| [Azedev](https://github.com/azedeveloper/meteor-litematica-printer/tree/main)

Auto-Wither | Automatically builds withers. [Meteor Rejects (updated for 1.21.5 by me)](https://github.com/AntiCope/meteor-rejects)

FastXP | Spam XP really fast to repair your armour, same as using Fast Use but only effects XP. [Blackout](https://github.com/KassuK1/BlackOut)
