# OMC Meteor Tools
A collection of meteor modules for my team (but also for others) designed to help and assist in advertising and making projects on 6b6t.
I like to call it a "collection" rather than an addon on its own since over half of the code is either ported from other clients or other addons

## Features (current)
Auto-Advertising | Lets you advertise in the chat with a delay and multiple messages, like the Macro function in meteor but you dont have to keep pressing the button

## Features (coming soon)

Meteor-Litematica-Printer (new) | A copy of the litematica printer module from Meteor-Litematica-Printer but its updated for 1.21.5
Auto-Wither | Taken from Meteor Rejects
MessageAura | When a player enters into a configurable distance, you can automatically send them a message.
and much more
